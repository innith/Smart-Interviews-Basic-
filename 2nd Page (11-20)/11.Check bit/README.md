# [Check bit](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/smart-interviews-basic/challenges/si-basic-check-bit/problem)

In a given integer N, check whether the ith bit is set or not.

## Input Format

First and only line of input contains N and i.

## Constraints

0 <= N <= 10<sup>9</sup></br>
0 <= i <= 30

## Output Format

Print "true" if ith bit is set in the given integer N, "false" otherwise.

## Sample Input 0
```
10 1
```
## Sample Output 0
```
true
```
## Explanation 0

The binary form of 10 is: 1010. So the 1st bit in 10 is set. Note that LSB bit is referred as 0th bit.
