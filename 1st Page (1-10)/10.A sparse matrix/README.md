# [A sparse matrix](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/smart-interviews-basic/challenges/si-basic-a-sparse-matrix/problem)

Given a matrix of size N x M, print whether it is a sparse matrix or not.</br>
Note: If a matrix contain 0 in more than half of its cells, then it is called a sparse matrix.

## Input Format

First line of input contains N, M - size of the matrix. Its followed by N lines each containing M intergers - elements of the matrix.

## Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 100</br>
0 <= ar[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## Output Format

Print "Yes" if the given matrix is a sparse matrix, otherwise print "No".

## Sample Input 0
```
2 3
5 0 0
0 8 0
```
## Sample Output 0
```
Yes
```
