# [Sum of two matrices](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/smart-interviews-basic/challenges/si-basic-sum-of-two-matrices/problem)

Given two matrices A and B each of size N x M, print sum of the matrices (A + B)..</br>
Note: Try solving it by declaring only a single matrix.

## Input Format

First line of input contains N, M - size of the matrices. Its followed by 2*N lines, each containing M integers - elements of the matrices. First N lines for matrix A and the next N lines for matrix B.

## Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 100</br>
-10<sup>9</sup> <= ar[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## Output Format

Print sum of the 2 given matrices (A + B).
