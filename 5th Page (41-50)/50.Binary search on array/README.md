# [Binary search on array](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/smart-interviews-basic/challenges/si-basic-binary-search-on-array/problem)
Given an array of integers, search a given key in the array using binary search.</br>
Note: Do not use any inbuilt functions/libraries for your main logic.</br>
(Try to practice both iterative and recursive codes for Binary Search)

## Input Format

First line of input contains two integers, N - size of the array and K - search key. Second line contains the elements of the array.

## Constraints

1 <= N <= 10<sup>2</sup> </br>
0 <= ar[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## Output Format

Print "true" if key is present in the array, otherwise, print false.

## Sample Input 0
```
5 19
2 19 23 35 38
```
## Sample Output 0
```
true
```
